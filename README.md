# eastern-roads (unfinished)
A game about fighting and capturing creatures from European and Asian folklore.

Base game components and design were created using only Java, JavaFX, and CSS.

This project was started in May of 2025, but I had to stop working on it due to a summer internship. I have not yet gotten around to implementing specific characters and fights.
